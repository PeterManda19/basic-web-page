In this project I explore building a basic responsive **web page.**

First I must work without any frameworks, then see what changes when I later work with a **CSS framework.**

**Intro**
A section with my full name and a photo of myself with Table Mountain in the background.

**Which city?**
I must add a section to my page about a city I would like to visit. I must explain why I want to visit the city and add one photo of this city to my page.

**A foreign language**
I must tell about what foreign language I would like to learn and why. This should not be a South African Language. I must add a table with 3-5 phrases in my language of choice that maps English phrases to the language I choose.

**Historic places in Johannesburg**
I must add a section to my page about three historic places in Johannesburg. Add a photo of myself at each of the places and add 3 interesting facts about these places.
