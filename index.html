        <h2>Which City?</h2>
        <img src="images/Stellenbosch.jpeg" alt="Description of the image" align="left" width="110" height="auto" >
        <p>The city I would like to visit is Stellenbosch. 
            Located in the heart of the Western Cape wine region, 
            Stellenbosch is a picturesque town that's surrounded by rolling vineyards and majestic mountains. 
            The mountains offer plenty of hiking trails and stunning views of the surrounding landscape. 
            It's a great place to sample some of the country's best wines and explore the 
            historic Cape Dutch architecture. 
            Stellenbosch is the second oldest town in South Africa, founded in 1679 by Simon van der Stel, 
            the Governor of the Cape Colony. 
            The city has a rich cultural heritage, with numerous museums, galleries, and historic buildings, 
            including the Village Museum, which showcases the town's colonial history. 
            The city has a vibrant food scene, with a variety of restaurants and cafes serving up delicious 
            local cuisine, including traditional South African dishes like bobotie and biltong. 
            Stellenbosch is a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with plenty of opportunities for 
            cycling, mountain biking, horse riding, and golfing. Overall, Stellenbosch is a fascinating and 
            beautiful city with a rich history and culture, world-class wine industry, and stunning natural 
            scenery, making it a must-visit destination in South Africa.

        <h2>Foreign Language</h2>
        <p>Swahili is a language that I would like to learn. 
            This Bantu language is spoken by over 100 million people in Africa, 
            and is the official language of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. 
            I am interested in learning Swahili because it is a widely spoken language in East Africa, 
            where I hope to travel one day. Additionally, Swahili has a rich history and culture associated with it. 
            For example, did you know that the word "Swahili" comes from the Arabic word "sahel," which means 
            "coast"? This reflects the historical influence of Arabic traders and settlers along the East African coast, 
            which has left a lasting impact on Swahili language and culture.
