					A Website Built with Flexbox: uses HTML and CSS to create a web page without a framework, 
					it's like building a project from scratch without any template to build from. 
					I have to figure out everything on my own, from where to put the 
					items on the web page.

				<ul class="menu side-bar">
					<li><a href="my-webpage.html"><strong>A Website Built with Flexbox</strong></a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					A Website Built with CSS Grid Framework. 
					A framework helps me build the web page faster and easier. 
					A framework is like a set of tools that already have some things figured out, 
					so when building the web page I do not have to start from scratch. 
					It is like having an already existing project that I can customize to my liking.
